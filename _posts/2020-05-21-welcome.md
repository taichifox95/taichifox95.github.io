## Hello!

Welcome to my site. This is the first time I ever try to utilize the GitHub page function, and it looks really amazing! I am using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme. I am completely new to these stuff, and this repo provides detailed documentation which helps me a lot.

Another reason to choose this theme is that I found this [helpful guide](https://ericranstrom.github.io/ericranstrom/general/unity_github_pages/) which allows me release my game demos based on Unity WebGL. It's really cool to display the game inside the page! So far it doesn't work as I expected, so I am using some walkarounds. Please try my first release [here](https://taichifox95.github.io/general/laser-defender/) if you haven't! I would keep updating on this.
